        <h1 class = "info">On 12 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[27]

            On 30 January 2020, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Thrissur, Kerala,[10] which rose to three cases by 3 February 2020; all were students returning from Wuhan.[28] Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February. On 4 March 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.[29] Transmissions increased over the month after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India.[30]
            
            A Sikh preacher, who had a travel history to Italy and Germany, turned into a superspreader by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib during 10â€“12 March.[31][32][33] Over 40,000 people in 20 villages in Punjab were quarantined on 27 March to contain the spread.[32][34] On 31 March, a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event in Delhi, which had taken place earlier in March, emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot.[35][36][37] On 2 May, around 4,000 stranded pilgrims returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra to Punjab. Many of them tested positive, including 27 bus drivers and conductors who had been part of the transport arrangement.[38][39][40]
            
            In July 2020, it was estimated based on antibody tests that at least 57% of the inhabitants of Mumbai's slums may have been infected with COVID-19 at some point.[41]
            
            A government panel on COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that the pandemic had peaked in India, and could come under control by February 2021.[42] This prediction was based on a mathematical simulation referred to as the "Indian Supermodel", assuming that India reaches herd immunity.[43][44][45][46] That month, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, Lineage B.1.617, was detected in the country.[47]
