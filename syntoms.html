        <h1 class = "info">Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[33][34] Common symptoms include headache,[35] loss of smell[36] and taste,[37] nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,[38] diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[39] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[39] In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[40]

            Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[41] At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[42][43][44][45] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.[45][46][47][48] Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[48]
            
            As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.[49] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[49][50]
            
            Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[51]
